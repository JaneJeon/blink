> _Decoupling the link shortener from analytics allows for flexible configuration fitting many use cases_

As outlined in the previous `Design Goals` section, the request path for any request on the "shortener" url (ex.co/foo) looks as follows:

```
First request (most likely you):
user <--> CDN <--> blink
           ^
           ㄴ-> access log

Following requests (the redirect is cached):
user <--> CDN --> access log

If you don't want to bother with a CDN:
user <--> blink --> access log
```

For analytics, you have two options. You can either go with the "serverless" route (and the blink server + postgres db should be lightweight enough to be _effectively_ serverless, making the entire stack ops-free), or the OLAP route (more traditional), where you shove everything into an OLAP database and just query it that way (there are more UIs built for this):

```
Serverless route:
access log --> lambda ETL --> store in S3 in columnar format (e.g. parquet) --> query w/ Athena

OLAP route:
access log --> ETL --> add row to OLAP --> query w/ some prebuilt solution
```

_Intimidated? Don't be. You can use the CDN's built-in analytics (e.g. CloudFlare, Fastly) for an out-of-the-box solution!_
