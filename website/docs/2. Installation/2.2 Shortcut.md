## Deploy the Server

Click the below button. Seriously.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

After you're done deploying, visit the dashboard at $YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com/app

This is a basic 12-factor node app, so you could also just run it on your server directly with `pm2`. If you're hosting on your own environment, take care to configure the Redis and Postgres URLs correctly.

Once you sign in with your SSO, make sure to give yourself admin privileges by running `npm run user:promote`. Note that this only works if you have signed up with SSO already and you're the only user; if someone else already signed up, find your user id and run `npm run user:promote $yourUserId`.

### Updating Heroku Source For the Server

In your clone of this repo, run:

    heroku git:remote -a $YOURAPPNAME
    git fetch origin vX.Y.Z
    git push heroku master

## CDN & Analytics

You actually _don't_ need analytics to use Blink; if you want to use Blink just to shorten links for yourself, you can stop right here.

If you want to a. cache Blink's shortened links, or b. get an insight into your links' traffic (e.g. who's clicking, how many clicks there were in the past week, etc), you can put a _simple_ CDN on top of Blink, and use the CDN's built-in analytics to track your link's traffic.

### Pointing the CDN to Your Blink Server

See https://www.pingdom.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-using-cdns-2/ for an example of how to use a CDN to cache contents of the Blink server.

TL;DR: point the domain of your choosing (e.g. https://bit.ly) to the URL of the server or its load-balanced endpoint (e.g. https://blink-server.herokuapp.com).

:::caution
Not all CDNs cache HTTP responses. For example, CloudFlare doesn't cache redirect responses (which is what Blink's entire architecture is built around) without enabling ["Cache Everything"](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/202775670) for Blink's domain/subdomain, which, unfortunately, uses up a Page Rule.

### Using the CDN's Built-in Analytics

Once you point a CDN to the Blink server, every request after the first one will be served by the CDN instead. This means the CDN has full information about every request to a shortened link, so you can use the CDN's built-in analytics (if the CDN supports it) to gain insight into the nature of the requests.

See https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics for an example of what analytics are available and how to use it (most CDNs expose some built-in request analytics).
